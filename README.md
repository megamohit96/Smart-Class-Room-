# Smart-Class-Room-
This is a project to automate the fans and Air Conditioners of a classroom depending on temperature of room and the number of people in the room. 

I would like to thank IoTa (Internet of Things Alliance), Department of IT, SRM University for giving me the oppurtunity to work on this project.
